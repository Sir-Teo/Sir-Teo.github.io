### April 13, 2018
I started by copying templates from the internet, cleaning them up, adding personal profiles and photos, fixing links. Now the 
Photo and Blog section is working fine. 

### April 14, 2018
Fixed links and added more articles and pictures. 

### April 16, 2018
I deleted some contents irrelevant to my website, and fixed more links so that they function well.
